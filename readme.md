RainDisaggGAN is a method that uses GANs for temporal downsampling spatial precipitation patterns.

The method is described in our paper (INSERT LINK)


This repository contains the trained network, an example script on how to use it for temporaral disaggregation,
and plots of samples generated by the method.

The example script is [generate_and_evaluate.py](generate_and_evaluate.py)

Plots are in the folder [plots_generated_wgancp_pixelnorm](plots_generated_wgancp_pixelnorm).
the files `generated_precip.....png` and `generated_fractions.....png` show examples of different daily scenarios generated for the same daily sum. (like
figure 2 in the paper). the former shows absolute precipitation, the latter shows fractions of the daily sum.


In order to fully replicate the study, you need to use the following scripts:

[download_smhi_radardata.py](download_smhi_radardata.py) downloads the raw radar data in geotiff format

[convert_smhi_radardata.py](convert_smhi_radardata.py) converts the raw radardate to daily netcdf files, including conversion
from radar reflectivities to precipitation

[reformat_data.py](reformat_data.py) reads in the netcdf data, aggregates it to desired aggregation (default 1h), and
outputs it in a single .npy file in a format suitable for machine learning

[compute_valid_indices.py](compute_valid_indices.py) reads in the data from reformat_data.py and calculates all possible
indices that have (1) no missing data an (2) pass a selection criterion for enough rainfall.
it outputs a .pkl file with the indices

[gan_train_cwgangp_pixelnorm.py](gan_train_cwgangp_pixelnorm.py)  trains the GAN, and makes some intermediate plots

[generate_and_evaluate.py](generate_and_evaluate.py) evaluates the GAN and makes analysis plots

The GAN is built and trained with Tensorflow 2.1.
The software was developed on Linux and to some amount relies on UNIX-like system commands.
Small adaptions might be necessary to run it on a windows computer. The example script 
[generate_and_evaluate.py](generate_and_evaluate.py) does not use UNIX-system commands and should run on any system.
Training the GAN is very slow without a GPU, but using the trained generator is computationally inexpensive and can 
easily be done on CPUs (even on a laptop)

Note that all datapaths in the scripts (except in the example scripts) need to be adapted to your local system.
Also the SLURM commands on top of the files need to be adapted if you use SLURM. If your don't use SLURM, you can simply ignore them.
